### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

#### config.yml

```yaml
# Maximum backtracking time (seconds)
max-back-time: 600

# Default language (en/zh)
language: en

# Record interval in seconds
record-interval: 1.0

# Minimum movement distance to record new position (blocks)
min-move-distance: 0.5
```

#### Configuration Explanation

- `max-back-time`: Maximum time players can go back, requests beyond this will be rejected
- `language`: Plugin interface language, supports `en` (English) and `zh` (Chinese)
- `record-interval`: How often to record player positions (recommended 1.0 second)
- `min-move-distance`: How far players need to move before recording a new position, prevents frequent recording

### üí° Usage Tips

1. **Set Reasonable Backtrack Time**: Don't set excessively long backtrack times as this consumes more memory
2. **Emergency Situations**: Quickly type `/btp` in dangerous situations to use default backtrack time
3. **Check Records**: Use `/btp info` to see how many location records you have
4. **Permission Setup**: You can assign different permissions to different player groups

### üîß Troubleshooting

**Q: Why does it show "No location records found for the specified time"?** A: This might be because:

- You haven't been online long enough
- The specified time exceeds the maximum backtrack time
- You didn't move during the specified time period

**Q: Will this plugin affect server performance?** A: No, the plugin is optimized:

- Only records when players move sufficient distance
- Automatically cleans expired data
- Clears data when players go offline

**Q: Can I go back to locations in other dimensions?** A: Yes, the plugin records complete location data including dimension information
